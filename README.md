 Project Description

The **Library Management System** is a Java-based application developed to address common challenges faced by libraries in the digital age. Our system aims to:

- Organize and manage a library’s book collection efficiently  
- Track items borrowed and returned by members  
- Maintain up-to-date and accurate member records  
- Automate day-to-day library operations for better productivity

Through this project, we provide a streamlined solution that reduces manual tasks and improves the overall user experience for librarians and library patrons alike.
